# Project SECURITY OverRide

## Introduction
This repository contains our solutions to the "Project SECURITY Over Ride," focusing on elf-like binary exploitation in i386 systems. Each solution demonstrates an understanding of RAM and security principles crucial for developing secure software.

## Project Structure
The project is structured with directories for each level, containing the exploited binary, a walkthrough of the solution, and any additional resources used.
The complete Pdf is available at the root of the project

## Solutions Overview
Each level directory contains:
- `source`: The source code or a detailed description of the exploited binary.
- `walkthrough`: A step-by-step guide explaining how the solution was reached.
- `flag`: The output or key result obtained from the level (if applicable).
- `Ressources`: Additional resources or scripts used in the solution.

## Key Learnings
- A deeper understanding of binary exploitation.
- Insights into common security vulnerabilities in programming.
- Development of critical problem-solving skills in IT security.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are part of an educational project. They are meant for learning and demonstrating security concepts in software development.

## Contributions
This project was made in collaboration with Lorenzo Edoardo Francesco. I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to him for his invaluable contributions. His insights, expertise, and dedication were pivotal in the success of this project. His ability to tackle complex problems with innovative solutions has been a source of inspiration throughout this journey. Working alongside Lorenzo has been an enriching experience, and I am profoundly grateful for the knowledge and perspectives he shared.
